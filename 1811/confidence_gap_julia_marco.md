  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: The Confidence Gap in Tech

  Introduction of yourself: I am Julia Marco, currently in mod4, in the BE program.

  Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? I selected this topic because I think it will be helpful for both the people who has experienced the impostor syndrome, like me, to know some facts, as well as some people who have not so be able to be more empathetic towards a topic like this, which is very much real and I think a good amount of students who attend Turing get to experience

  Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic:
  The role confidence plays in career pathways is often overlooked. The data suggests that it affects large segments of young people that may be considering a career in information technology. The main concerns most people go through is lacking some skills, starting too far behind, and the fear of failure. As a research study of 1,000 18- to 34-year-olds shows, fully 7 in 10 of these individuals cite confidence as a factor that contributes to discouragement taking the first step towards a career in technology. Among young adults considering a career in technology, 42% express concern over feeling ill-prepared because of insufficient exposure to technology in high school.

  I also want to emphasize the confidence gap already existing between genders. Evidence shows that women are less self-assured than menâ€”and that to succeed, confidence matters as much as competence. I want to show some data about this.

  How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? I think it's important to have the information with you, no matter what "side" you are in. You can benefit from this information in order to try and change things.

  How will this impact you as a developer? I feel extremely close to all the information and I think seeing the data and acknowledging that it is a thing that doesn't only apply or affects me, but many other people, is comforting.

  Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1.What is the confidence gap?
    2.How does it impact people with different identities?
    3.How can you gain more confidence if you don't have it?  I think of people saying ""be more confident"" but that doesn't just happen."

   Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________
